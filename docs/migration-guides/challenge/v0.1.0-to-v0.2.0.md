# [v0.2.0]

## BREAKING CHANGE

Following changes in AccelByte Gaming Services OpenAPI specification:

- `challenge`: Operation `public_get_scheduled_goals` had its response changed from `List[ModelGoalResponse]` into `ModelGetGoalsResponse`.

* A bunch of `enums` has also been removed. Howeever, you can still use their string representation.
