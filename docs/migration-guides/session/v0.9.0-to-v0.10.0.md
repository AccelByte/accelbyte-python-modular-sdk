# [v0.10.0]

## BREAKING CHANGE

Following changes in AccelByte Gaming Services OpenAPI specification:

- `session`: Model `ApimodelsPlayerAttributesRequestBody` has a new required field `simultaneous_platform`.
- `session`: Model `ApimodelsUserResponse` has a new required field `previous_status`.

* A bunch of `enums` has also been removed. Howeever, you can still use their string representation.
